	abstract = {Based on the k-mer model for genetic sequence, a k-mer sparse matrix representation is proposed to denote the types and sites of k-mers appearing in a genetic sequence, and there exists a one-to-one relationship between a genetic sequence and its associated k-mer sparse matrix. With the singular value decomposition of the k-mer sparse matrix, the k-mer singular value vector is constructed and utilized to numerically quantify the characteristics of a genetic sequence. We investigate and evaluate the optimum value k⁎ chosen for our k-mer sparse matrix model for genetic sequence. To show the usefulness of our k-mer sparse matrix model method, it is applied to the comparison of genetic sequences, and the results obtained fully demonstrate that our proposed method is very powerful in analyzing and determining the relationships of genetic sequences.},

The dinucleotide composition was significantly different between the organisms. The distribution of genes from an organism was clustered around its center in the dinucleotide composition space. The genes from closely related organisms such as Gram-negative bacteria, mycoplasma species and eukaryotes showed some overlap in the space. The genes from nine complete genomes together with those from human were discriminated into respective clusters with 80\% accuracy using the dinucleotide composition alone. The composition data estimated from a whole genome was close to that obtained from genes, indicating that the characteristic feature of dinucleotides holds not only for protein coding regions but also noncoding regions. When a dendrogram was constructed from the disposition of the clusters in the dinucleotide space, it resembled the real phylogenetic tree. Thus, the distinct feature observed in the dinucleotide composition may reflect the phylogenetic relationship of organisms.},

For each of the organisms studied, tetranucleotide usage departures from expectations (TUD) were shared between related organisms using both Markov chain analysis and a zero-order Markov method. Individual strains, multiple chromosomes, plasmids, and bacteriophages share TUDs within a species. TUDs varied between coding and noncoding DNA. Grouping prokaryotes based on TUD profiles resulted in relationships with important differences from those based on 16S rRNA phylogenies, which may reflect unequal rates of evolution of nucleotide usage patterns following divergence of particular organisms from a common ancestor. By both symmetrical tree distance and likelihood analysis, phylogenetic trees based on TUD profiles demonstrate a level of congruence with 16S rRNA trees similar to that of both RpoA and RecA trees. Congruence of these trees indicates that there exists phylogenetic signal in TUD patterns, most prominent in coding region DNA. Because relationships demonstrated in TUD-based analyses utilize whole genomes, they should be considered complementary to phylogenies based on single genetic elements, such as 16S rRNA.},

Applied to a total of 109 organisms, including 16 Archaea, 87 Bacteria, and 6 Eukarya, it yields an unrooted tree that agrees with the biologists' "tree of life" based on SSU rRNA comparison in a majority of basic branchings, and especially, in all lower taxa.},

	shorttitle = {Amino acid composition of genomes, lifestyles of organisms, and evolutionary trends},
	abstract = {Can we infer the lifestyle of an organism from the characteristic properties of its genome? More precisely, what are the relations between easily quantifiable properties from genomic sequences, such as amino-acid compositions, and more subtle characteristics concerning for example lifestyles or evolutionary trends? Here, we seek a global picture for such properties, based on a large number (56) of complete genomes, including significant numbers of representatives from the three domains of life. We consider the amino acid compositions of the predicted proteomes, and we use correspondence analysis, as a multivariate method to extract the relevant information from the large-scale data. From these analyses we derive a series of conclusions, concerning lifestyles, as well as physico-chemical and evolutionary trends: (1) correspondence analysis of the amino acid compositions permits discrimination between the three known lifestyles (mesophily/thermophily/hyperthermophily). (2) For various organisms, amino-acid composition properties are essentially driven by GC content, and to a significantly lesser extent by growth temperatures associated with lifestyles. Roughly speaking, the respective contributions of these two components are 57 and 20\%. It is notable that these proportions are essentially unchanged with respect to a previous analysis (Nature 393 (1998) 537), which involved only 15 genomes, available at the time. (3) In terms of amino acid compositional biases, two specific 'signatures' for thermophily (in a broad sense, including hyperthermophily) can be detected. First, thermophilic species display a relative abundance in glutamic acid (Glu), concomitantly with the depletion in glutamine. Second, in thermophilic species, the relative abundance in Glu (negative charge) is significantly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient r=0.83 with P{\textless}0.0001), with the increase in the lumped 'pool' lysine+arginine (positive charges). This correlation (absent in mesophiles) could be interpreted on a physico-chemical basis, relevant to the thermostability of proteins. (4) Statistically significant differences are observed between the average lengths of the genes in the surveyed species, which follow their distribution between the three domains of life. Also a significant difference is observed between the average lengths of thermophilic (283.0+/-5.8) versus mesophilic (340+/-9.4) genes. It is thus possible that the 'general' shortening of the primary sequences in thermophilic proteins plays a role in thermostability. (5) Considering various combinations of conservation properties (genes conserved exclusively in eukaryotes, in archaea, in bacteria, in combinations of two domains, etc.) correspondence analysis reveals a trend towards thermophilic-hyperthermophilic profiles for the most conserved subset of genes (ancient genes). (6) When limited to the subset of species-specific genes, correspondence analysis leads to a different picture for the clustering of genomes following amino-acid compositions: for example, the 'core' specific part of a genome can bear lifestyle signatures different from those of the complete genome.Various results are discussed both on methodological and biological grounds. The evolutionary perspectives opened by our analyses are noted.},

Hierarchical clustering of the distributions of doublets of 30 miscellaneous coding sequences gives clusters in reasonable agreement with accepted biological classifications.

These have become so plentiful that alignment-free sequence comparison is of growing importance in the race between scientists and sequencing machines. In phylogenetics, efficient distance computation is the major contribution of alignment-free methods. A distance measure should reflect the number of substitutions per site, which underlies classical alignment-based phylogeny reconstruction. Alignment-free distance measures are either based on word counts or on match lengths, and I apply examples of both approaches to simulated and real data to assess their accuracy and efficiency. While phylogeny reconstruction is based on the number of substitutions, in population genetics, the distribution of mutations along a sequence is also considered. This distribution can be explored by match lengths, thus opening the prospect of alignment-free population genomics.},

Very little is known about the accuracy with which such alignment-free methods recover the correct phylogeny or about the potential for increasing their accuracy. We conducted a large-scale comparison of ten alignment-free methods, among them one new approach that does not calculate distances and a faster variant of our pattern-based approach; all distance-based alignment-free methods are freely available from http://www.bioinformatics.org.au (as Python package decaf+py). We show that most methods exhibit a higher overall reconstruction accuracy in the presence of high among-site rate variation. Under all conditions that we considered, variants of the pattern-based approach were significantly better than the other alignment-free methods. The new pattern-based variant achieved a speed-up of an order of magnitude in the distance calculation step, accompanied by a small loss of tree reconstruction accuracy. A method of Bayesian inference from k-mers did not improve on classical alignment-free (and distance-based) methods but may still offer other advantages due to its Bayesian nature. We found the optimal word length k of word-based methods to be stable across various data sets, and we provide parameter ranges for two different alphabets. The influence of these alphabets was analyzed to reveal a trade-off in reconstruction accuracy between long and short branches. We have mapped the phylogenetic accuracy for many alignment-free methods, among them several recently introduced ones, and increased our understanding of their behavior in response to biologically important parameters. In all experiments, the pattern-based approach emerged as superior, at the expense of higher resource consumption. Nonetheless, no alignment-free method that we examined recovers the correct phylogeny as accurately as does an approach based on maximum-likelihood distance estimates of multiply aligned sequences.},

The existing phylogenomic methods all use assembled sequences, which are often not available owing to the difficulty of assembling short-reads; this obstructs phylogenetic investigations on species without a reference genome. In this report, we present co-phylog, an assembly-free phylogenomic approach that creates a 'micro-alignment' at each 'object' in the sequence using the 'context' of the object and calculates pairwise distances before reconstructing the phylogenetic tree based on those distances. We explored the parameters' usages and the optimal working range of co-phylog, assessed co-phylog using the simulated next-generation sequencing (NGS) data and the real NGS raw data. We also compared co-phylog method with traditional alignment and alignment-free methods and illustrated the advantages and limitations of co-phylog method. In conclusion, we demonstrated that co-phylog is efficient algorithm and that it delivers high resolution and accurate phylogenies using whole-genome unassembled sequencing data, especially in the case of closely related organisms, thereby significantly alleviating the computational burden in the genomic era.},
